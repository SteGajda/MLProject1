the third game would have been a lot more interesting with one change the platforms are hexagons much smaller and with several more of them on screen at once so that youre always in danger of falling into a hole and not exactly sure where the path is going furthermore after reading several other comments i agree about crediting the developers however everyone needs to realise that the prices were agreed upon before development and the prices were integral to the experiment if the developers were not ok with the amounts they were paid then they wouldnt have accepted the job,neutral

just a few things to note about the bigoh notation discussed in this episode in industry bigoh notation alone is what is seen when discussing algorithms however in academia it is a bit more in depth on is instead used to represent an upperbound in the worst case what is this problem or algorithm ωn pronounced bigomega is used to represent the lowerbound in the best case what is this problem or algorithm θn prounounced theta without the big is used to represent the tightbound used when the bigoh is equal to the bigomega which is the exact running time there is also small omega and small o but those are rarely used also we only care about the biggest polynomial when we use this notation so if a problem takes 5n4 3n2 1 to do we just say it is θn4 we drop the coefficient and smaller terms because we only care about what happens when n is really really big you may notice that earlier i mentioned algorithm or problem when describing the notation this is because the it is often used in academia to denote all of the algorithms that exist for a problem for example for matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix we have ωn2 since we know that we at least need to read in n2 values this problem currently has on23728639 which is the running time of an algorithm created by francois le gall in 2014,neutral

from my point of view the selection of varane is decisive when the defense lacks solidity all areas of the game suffer his presence and the quality of his interventions gave confidence to the whole team including martinez who was also much more efficient i wonder if in reality varane is not the man of the match even without being the best on the field sometimes the balance of a team depends on very little,neutral

masters union cannot replace institutions like iim or iit because of the sheer fact that mu does not have to comply with the guidelines of a college or a university indian colleges or universities dont have any place in the top institutes of the world and rightly so but something that an iit or iim has to deal with that none of the other institutes in the world deals with is the implementation of the reservation policy because of the implementation of reservation there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into iims and iits be lacking in certain core subjects dont assume i am a casteist because i am outlining a drawback in reservation policy i completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of 200 years but the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who havent had access to great education in their schoolscolleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education but in an institution like masters union going by their fees structure and the absence of any deferral of fees payment or scholarship the students generally come from priveleged backgrounds who have had access to great education since kindergarten while masters union assures great education institutions like iits and iims ensure social equity and great education the entire para is based on my knowledge that there are no reservations in mu,negative

i think it is a very good exercise to imagine yourself in your death bed every now and then to prepare yourself for this you must read the 9th chapter of the death of ivan ilyich again just a very short chapter where ivan lies all alone and in terrible pain in his bed he suddenly hears the voice of his own soul saying what do you want what do you want he says what do i want to live and not to suffer so his inner voice says to live how to live as i used to well and pleasantly as you lived before well and pleasantly here is how tolstoy continues and in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant life but strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant life now seemed at all what they had then seemed none of them except the first recollections of childhood there in childhood there had been something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live if it could return but the child who had experienced that happiness existed no longer it was like a reminiscence of somebody else as soon as the period began which had produced the present ivan ilyich all that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned into something trivial and often nasty so as he keeps looking back on his life his thoughts become darker and darker he basically realises that his entire life had been a lie he lived for what the others expected from him for money power and statushe wasted the time given to him in this world and now there is no way back indeed we all must keep ivan ilyich in mind every day just consider how fast the time goes by how much of it do we really spend seriously thinking about our lives very little indeed because it requires a certain level of focus and depth which we dont have most of the time thats why this scene is a great reminder so as we make the death bed exercise i have just mentioned we can use the very questions that ivan ilyichs soul was asking him i think people who live well deal with their mortality better so doing this exercise regularly can help us to live and die better thank you for this wonderful lesson i love tolstoy,neutral

to everyone whos studying with this music checklist • a bottle of water at least 1liter your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate • your charger you sometimes dont even notice that your devices battery is going down so better have it plugged in all the time • your headphones you will be able to focus more with headphones because it blocks background noises also if its a late night study session you wont wake up anyone • a tea or coffee coffee keeps you awake green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well • your studywork stuff your laptoptabletphone a few pens paper or whatever you need •anything else you could need what about a heat pad a blanket a good lamp your pet so you have a study buddy  reminder after an hour you should stand up and walk a bit around better stop the music or put on different music for the break open your window even if its cold outside fresh air will make it better trust me you could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast or if you have to read a book listen to the audiobook of it you can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing thats even better than listening to music while reading the book ´▽ʃ♡ƪ i hope yall had a good day if not thats okay too remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight  and remember if youre going through anything hard im here to listen and talk to you ik im just a stranger but im human too 3 you can reply or we can chat on discord if youre not confident talking here ♡ — love you stranger ♡,positive

my take probably messed some up 1 the cane gets stabilized by the fact that the lighter side of the cane gets less friction form your finger than the heavier side so that finger moves faster towards the com of the cane this causes the effect to flip and the fingers slowly align themselves around the center of mass 2 the phone is not evenly weighed so spinning it in some axis would make it destabilize right well the same effect is observed when spinning a brick it fell on my foot twice while i tested that that i played around with i believe this effect occurs because of the fact that the center of mass of the brickphone is in the middle of the whole object so rotating it around the axis that allows more mass to rotate around further from the com will work because the particles far away have to have less momentum the spin is easier on the other hand spinning the phone the other way makes more particles have more energy so this state is unstable the phone starts to spin in a way that makes some of the particles decelerate which is a more stable state rhyme unintended the same thing is observed when spinning around and then extending your hands out which causes you to decelerate 3 this one is a bit of a troll i tested deuterium water and distilled water and the distilled one produced no less effect it’s not the water that is attracted to the cup it’s the stuff in it ions 4 the cereal contains some iron which is magnetic this makes it attracted to the magnet maybe but what is interesting is that water and glass fex are pushed away by magnets it’s diamagnetic anyways maybe the magnet makes like a small cavity in the water that the cereal falls into i did not observe one i do not know but i did manage to destroy a box of good cereal and throw the cereal all over the floor 5 hot air rises as the hot air creates a rising bubble the material the tea bag is made out of slowly burns away when it gets light enough it slowly flies up hope i am correct hand have a nice day edit watched the answers video,neutral

pretty good summary i disagree with the statement that it isnt a science however cs researchers routinely make falsifiable claims about the real world and then test those claims through experiments in fact thats how im spending my winter holiday like if i solve this problem with method x instead of method y i get a more reliable answer of course if you only have empirical evidence ie its been tested in the real world your case is weaker than if you have a mathematical proof so in that way it might be that some problems cs folks tackle are scientific empirical questions until they can be handled more rigorously with mathematics but some big popular branches of cs like machine learning and ai advance primarily through empirical rather than mathematic evidence whether mathematics itself is a science i will leave to the writers of dictionaries,neutral

theres a lot more unusual stuff under the hood of these guys and their echidna cousins their skeletons for example have epipubic bones aka pouch bones which are only found in marsupials and monotremes but more unusual still they have 3 bones in their pectoral girdle while all other mammals have only two on a human for example the pectoral girdle aka the bones that link the arms to the rest of the skeleton and make up the shoulder is made of two bones the scapula shoulder blade and clavicle collar bone with one running to the back and the other linking up at a socket in the sternum it means that we like all mammals can pivot our shoulders around not just the arms within the socket compare this to birdsreptiles and older tetrapod groups and youll find that the pectoral girdle is a fused mass just like the pelvic girdle with two bones at the front that firmly anchor the shoulders in place to the sternum this third bone is the coracoid bone and mammals lost it a long time ago except in monotremes on the plus though like the rigid flight frame of a bird it provides a very solid anchor for powerful forelimbs which is why platypus primarily use their forelimbs to swim or echidna to dig splayed legs more ribs than other mammals low body heat eggs venom etc honestly make platypus and echidna more like lizards in a furry costume than just a beaver with a duck bill or a pointynosed hedgehog,neutral

i agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time i think theres a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about democratization and the experience catch 22 i feel like your video alluded to what i mean by democratization quite well so i think were probably in agreement there a lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow pytorch and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models i think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boilerplate enough that its ripe for automation using some kind of automl the sqllike syntax that redshift and bigquery offer or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away this opens ml models up to the techsavy but nonspecialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and mlops we still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often its just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day for experience i really think theres a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless selfteaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people this is where i think we disagree the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you dont talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience the largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you i would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level my expectation is that youd see a massive gap favoring employers at 02 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5 years of experience so while the industry is expanding the companies arent hiring juniors or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program together i think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals if workers with domain experience but not a ds education can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job i think were going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree,positive

regarding cans vs bottles at least in germany the bottle is more environmentally friendly since they get used again and again you bring the empty bottles to the local grocery shop they then get sent to a cleaning plant where they pressurewash the bottles inside and out with steaming hot water afterwards they get reused for beer the size and shape of most bottles is according to a standard so different brewers use the same bottles its far less energy intense than smelting and remanufacturing cans,neutral

imo whats most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly theyre hoping to get out of these deals everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money but then what i have to wonder is if gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios then why wouldnt they turn down ps in theory gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties weve also seen plenty of evidence that xbox is swimming in microsoft money so they should easily have the means to outbid sony for games they want on their service as well as typical console exclusives for that matter yet we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to sonys deals and stipulations if a studio wanted to join gp and told sony they would decline their gp restriction contract i can see them getting less marketing on ps but i highly doubt sony wouldnt want their sales cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with sony but i dont know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line it just seems to me like somehow many studios arent jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it that or gp isnt as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think no shade at gp i love it just saying i dont get how ms would be losing out to sonys contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place,positive

we are so obsessed with time just like someone already said in the comments but on the other hand we will always find time for the things that truly matter to us and thats what laura vanderkam says in her talk i used to rush myself on the bike to school and i love cycling but i wanted to be there as fast as possible so that id have more time to study yet every time i would rush through id be stopped at the red lights and the slower cyclers would catch up with me making me feel frustrated with the time i was wasting waiting at the red lights all i was left with was more sweat frustration and muscle pain so i decided this was not going to do it now i cycle every morning to school at a slow pace enjoying the nature the rain the sunshine the wind the smells of life everything listening to the city or the birds i even have time to stop if i see a cat and try to give it some snacks i arrive at school feeling relaxed and ready for the day its my favorite thing to do now making a priority list will make your life better especially the relationships and self categories taking time to just be present in the moment and live ignore the smartphone and technology as long as possible and talk to your loved ones instead or instead of procrastinating by scrolling through facebook watch a ted talk you wont feel like youve wasted your time after that thanks for the inspiring talk im getting back to work now time to review my priority list,neutral
i love the grounded reality of this channeli started in crypto in august 2017 and i bought ini was up 5x by december only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch the original investment go down by about 85 during the ensuing 4 year bear market i took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do i wish i had bought more i am in profit for now but i am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from dickson jenkinshave learned from you and other youtubrs especially my mentor dickson jenkins who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 2btc to 13btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market and i know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past it is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research,positive

trying to make sense of cryptocurrencies can be a bit overwhelming for investors its a nascent but promising asset class built on technology that has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries for investors whats probably most attractive is the possibility of lifechanging returns dont worry youre not late to the crypto party were likely still in the very early innings leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market if youre new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert i have learned from alot of youtubers especially my mentor gerard mcdonald who taught me how to make trade and increase my portfolio to 19 btc lately,positive

the video is great especially when you talk about the agency business model although i disagree about some other business models generalizations for example on affiliate marketing nobody says you get paid once its an option theres revenue sharing pay per sale etc from dropshipping you can also get recurring with monthly kits or other types of products that have a smaller life cycle costumer the margins game is highly variable and thats where some people get ahead of others nevertheless selling roi services for businesses is still great for beginners but in the future it would be wise to get traffic in other ways while also building a brand for your agency website content and all,positive

i dont have a series x yet and although series s is a great console the fact is all digital is a no go for me the reason is that i have a good collection of xbox 360 and xbox one physical games and some of them such as older forza horizon or forza motorsport games are not available to buy digitally anymore due to license issues so the only way of playing those games is using the disc i would be happy with a series so with disc drive but as this is not an option ill have to go with the series x another point is that although gamepass is great i had it for two years and experienced great games including halo infinite i think it is a bit too expensive if it was 80 per year as the live gold was it would be a no brainer but at 15 per month 180 per year i think it is too expensive you can use that money and buy over 7 aaa games on physical or digital sale for that price assuming an average cost of 25 per game,neutral

the reason why 1 works isn’t just because of the method but because in the first case you only have one finger the center of mass is always a point and since you’ve only got one point of contact where your finger touches the cane there is effectively a 0 chance the center of mass is exactly on that contact point and thus starts leaning towards one side or another if you use the second method there’s two points of contact and thus as long as the center of mass is inbetween it cannot tilt you can try finding the center of mass on your own with two fingers together without using the special method and just doing it normally and you’ll see it works fine tldr you don’t need a special method to balance on the center of mass you just need two fingers so that there are two contact points for the center of mass to be between,neutral

truly inspiring video the presentation is truly flawless and the few frames of minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game i love how you used pocket edition because its unique and different than most minecraft videos being published today using pc or console versions of the game and i really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles i really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding if you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay we can find that the player is holding a torch just like the many around his shelter this means the torches around the base has just been placed and shows how you can move forward in life no matter how dire the situation may seem in the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning showing how even if someone is in their home they are never safe of the dangers outside and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety i also appreciate the 4 chests in the form of a rectangular shape which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls not to mention the way the player looks out the exit as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there and how even though you may be small compared to the universe the impact you make can change the world another very symbolic part of this film is the ending where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the players dedication it also is in a slightly smaller frame and black bars replace the outer edges which show that even though you try your best there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey and how much different it could have been if you have done something different which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of minecraft as long as possible without itching ones testicles the background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt blue or sad about ending but still proud of what they accomplished and is hopeful for what is to come a really poetic performance really captures the ups and downs needed to be overcome in what seems to be a simple sandbox game can be dramatically multiplied with the added challenge of persevering through the hardships of avoiding the constant urge to scratch ones balls i cant wait to see more work from you 1010 simply phenomenal,positive

underrated i agree he’s extremely good at game development but he also has millions of subscribers millions more viewers and two of his later games both got incredibly well received and took the front page of steam by storm not to mention karlson is incredibly anticipated by millions and one of the most wishlisted games on steam many other solo gamedevs out there who pour just as much if not more time and effort into making games just as good could not dream of that someone who likely everyone who clicked on this video already knows is not what i’d call underrated there are plenty of smaller game devs who are overshadowed by the more well known ones like dani i’m not saying it’s his fault or anything i watch him and support him i’m just saying the claim that he’s underrated let alone the most underrated is incredibly wrong as far as i’m concerned,positive
i have ptsd and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts it is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened you keep thinking about the event and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened to get it to stop replaying in your head this can be at all different levels from avoiding certain types of people to avoiding groups public transportation or in some cases avoiding people altogether violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations but most people with ptsd arent violent if anything most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation i guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts the idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth at least ive never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that you dont have real flashbacks like hallucinations you just can not stop thinking about what happened why it happened how you could have stopped it and etc like anyone in a traumatic event issue is usually it goes away after a bit where in ptsd you still keep dwelling on it years later,negative

nuclear is a great carbonfree base load electricity source i’d like to see it not as a competition but rather a companion to renewables in the future electrical generation portfolio on the downside nuclear is expensive to build and insure but the actual watts generated are among the cheapest there are also concerns about the total available uranium to run the reactors and it seems like we’ll have enough of it for 50100 years if we generate 4050 of the energy from nuclear on top of that thorium reactors could be a viable alternative to their uranium counterparts another new direction in nuclear is small modular reactors 4th gen which in theory should be much cheaper to build and run making initial investment lower they would also give us greater agility in planning the electrical grid,neutral

emils perspective is a classic example of the fallacy of zero sum thinking where shallow thinkers believe that when one side wins the other necessarily losses of course when it comes to things like chess this kind of thinking is completely erroneous and on the contrary when one side wins both sides win what is good for one aspect of chess is broadly speaking good for chess as a whole we should be doing everything possible to broaden chesss appeal garner additional exposure and grow its global popularity and online chess obviously plays an enormous role in that process what is good for online chess is also good for otb chess fide and other large bureaucratic institutions will hopefully eventually recognize and embrace this too,neutral

computer science gives you a language to communicate your technical ideas as well as a framework and tools to evaluate them and while you can learn programmingdevelopment by watching a bunch of youtube videos if you lack the basic cs knowledge you will always struggle to make technical choices come up with a poorsuboptimal design while this is understandable that for some people the cs curriculum means a lot of depth which it certainly is it has big rewards on your software engineering job once you learn it well it is easy to supplement knowledge related to the latest trending technology but if you have knowledge gaps in your fundamentals youre gonna have a hard time overcoming those,positive

yes there’s ambiguity in role definitions in my previous company i worked as data scientist however i hardly did any data science work it was more like a developer work where i was assigned to test and deploy the ml models in production i could learn a lot about aws cloud architecture and services trouble shoot real time issues but did little of ml then i changed my job and joined as data analyst here i do little of analysis sql etc and more of ml like developing models and fine tuning them cleaning the data feature engineering and feature selection i would caution the people aspiring to enter the field because many a times companies themselves are not sure where and how they are going to use data science what are the prerequisites for a successful data science project they lack quality data if they do have data accessing and compiling the data is another issue after aligning with multiple departments as single man army you are expected to give some magical results when results are satisfactory you will be asked to deploy them here again the streamlined organisational requirements are missing somehow you drag the project later you are expected to monitor and troubleshoot issues in production and then after all of this single man army efforts management doesn’t see any value in it just to keep up with trend companies end up hiring a data scientist and expect that person to assume multiple roles and give them an end to end solution they are just giving analytics a try without investing much in it,neutral
