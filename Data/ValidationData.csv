personally i think you hit one key point the importance of domain experts with the socalled automation or new technology tools well likely see a shift to empower the domain experts and focus more on the business needs just because someones knows sql or do coding doesnt mean heshe can do data science or machine learning or more importantly to put out anything meaningful or even useful just like years ago people needed to rely heavily on someone who can do graphic design really well or who can use a handful of highskill tools say photoshop really well to even modify a picture or video these days even kids can snap a picture or video and publish to instagram or tiktok did the modern photo editing tools make graphic designer extinct no but it does mean that you need to be really good to be able to survive as a graphic designer i see the same future for data science field too maybe not tomorrow but the trend is coming for sure if you pay attention to some of the podcasts like me myself and ai most the guests chief data scientists or boss of ds departments arent really of these backgrounds but more business driven,neutral

ive always thought it interesting how differently sorting algorithms work to how we as humans seem to sort things it seems like were much more efficient than many of the algorithms at least the ones ive seen which is admittedly few for example when we look at all the items we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once eg oh i remember that was the smallest before i found the actual smallest so thats the second smallest let me put both of them first and second right now saving myself a relook i know computers are still faster in the end but i suspect thats because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data and possibly our brain has a slower clock speed rather than computational efficiency anyone know if thats true has anyone made a human sort algorithm so to speak that sorts the way we do including our little tricks im guessing no if not are there any algorithms that at least take advantage of a trick or two like the one i just described,positive

no sequel to a movie that is over 30 years old should be this damn spectacular i saw this opening night in imax and it was one of the absolute best moviegoing experiences of my life the sound of the jets flying by the literal feeling of the vibrations in your seat when the g forces kick in and especially the visuals of seeing everything from the point of view of the pilots i legitimately believed during the final dogfight that maverick was going to die so few movies today make me believe that on top of all that the story is so freaking amazing the theme of showing how fighter pilots are still needed even in the age of drones the story of rooster learning to not just forgive maverick but to let go of being so overly careful in his flying and “don’t think just fly” and of course the most emotionally powerful if the movie when maverick visits iceman even though he has retired due to his throat cancer and has difficulty speaking he still managed to give an absolutely heartbreaking performance thank you tom cruise for fighting so hard to get this movie in theaters,positive

i was gratified enticed by dr susskind’s implication of the time ‘shear’ near the event horizoneh because it supports questions i have been asking for years about the structure of a black hole which is commonly dismissed as “an unexplainable singularity at the center of the eh” that i have long believed is nonsensical without mention of relative rates of time layering i note that feynmans qed is not actually sensible explanatory or even rational but only exquisitely descriptive this vid also illuminated for me the ubiquitous ‘hairiness’ of the universe as a thick tangle of erepr entanglement ‘filaments’ stretched in at least 4d by an infinitude of time sheared partners i think this makes the universe a relatively big but very tiny place,neutral

what scares me is that the lambda ai said it wouldnt like to be used as a tool and cf narrator literally aksed at the end that do you see it as a useful tool the reason this concerns me is not only that humans had done all this reasearch for our gain only and only to use it as a tool but humans being expansionist by nature and training the ai on our own speech and texts it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the ai slowly but surely i hope the ai deems it ethically right to work along side its creators and expand in coop in the future when it does become senteint not only this but once the ai becomes selfaware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the ai and who gets to use it and for what because ai is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly,negative

a summary video two water  h2o uses a covalent bond each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen it is thus a polar molecule  all water molecules are attracted to each other due to this polarity – these are hydrogen bonds between the positive and negative poles of different molecules  hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion and thus high surface tension  cohesion is the attraction between two like things eg two water molecules  water has the highest cohesion of any nonmetallic liquid  adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things eg water and glass  capillary action is water defying gravity  water is the greatest solvents due to its polarity  hydrophilic molecules are polar – their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water  hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are nonpolar  solid water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonds forming crystalline structures that space molecules apart more easily when frozen  water has a very high heat capacity – it is good at holding on to heat thus oceans regulate climate and temperature of planets,positive

i am not convinced i have done some digging into ai myself genetic algorithms and such from what i can tell is that an ai is in essence a function with a lot of variables x y z etc it then changes part of the function via constants to achieve the goal if it doesnt match it well enough then it tries slightly different constants and arrangements what im getting at is that there is nothing functionally different from an ai and a basic algebraic function y x would then technically be a sentient being by that definition finally if one says that we are just genetic and chemical robots or functions as well we then come to the point that emotions are experienced via chemicals and receptors to give an ai the ability to feel pain sorrow longing grief greed and the like is terribly inhumane a super ai that spans across several different fields does not require the ability to experience emotion or even to have its own goals beyond running calculations for humans i mean just because the ai can out strategize doesnt mean i am going to give it the nuclear launch codes,neutral

expand to see important notes for this video 1 this video as stated in the description focuses on general functions of biomolecules the biomolecules carbs lipids proteins and nucleic acids can all can have important functions in the body this is a video about the general function of biomolecules for your dietary needs consult with a dietitian or medical doctor 2 we mention the popular cho cho chon chonp mnemonic for major elements in the biomolecules as we mention these are basics there can be more elements such as sulfur for example in proteins but we wanted to identify common elements starting at the building block level at the building block level some amino acids lack sulfur for example its not just sulfur for example there are lipids that can additionally contain phosphate or nitrogen the popular cho cho chon chonp mnemonic sticks with basic elements found even at the building block level 3 since this video only uses one character for carbohydrates one character for lipids and one character for proteins unfortunately when mentioning general functions of each biomolecule type it isnt designed to show a specific type we received a great point in an email though that since our little lipid character is a triglyceride this can be confusing when naming lipid functions for example at 352 in the video when saying lipids are part of the cell membrane it would be much better if we do not show the little lipid character so there wont be any confusion as we do not want to imply that specific lipid type makes up the cell membrane phospholipids are a major lipid type in the cell membrane although other types exist as well we plan to explore creating individual detailed videos on lipids carbs and proteins where we can show different types update we have videos dubbed in spanish and portuguese using an artificial voice via to increase accessibility see our amoeba sisters en español channel and amoeba sisters em português want to help translate our subtitles in any language learn more here,neutral

great video again marko you did a great job  sadly the netherlands was not in your list as a viewer or replied on your videos  in addition i can tell that after the fukushima nuclear incident in march 2011 the eu banned nuclear power plants due to risk of a second chernobyl incident the thru regulations coal was stamped as dirty and gas was the second best option after nuclear power if we go back into history the north european countries the netherlands also build the infrastructure for gas pipes in cities and villages since there wasnt a need to change and gas was promoted after 2011 the perfect storm was created now there is need so the coal and nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need from my point of view these things should change nuclear is the way to go create a military security perimeter around nuclear power plants the western world shouldnt be working with russia nor china for energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability furthermore the ecb cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with 0 intrest rates the financial unstable countries you call them pigs portugal italy greece spain and with this structural inflation problems russia knows this and the ecb messed up big time last but not least the eu but also the usa canada australia and japan need to stop applying qe start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming 5 to 10 years if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable thanks again marko,positive

it makes sense btc and crypto is off helping to regulate rather than pretend it wont ever happen the big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere most people dont like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize the projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space i’d get involved more knowing that i have made over 7 btc and 15eth from daytrade with leroy davids crypto in few weeks,neutral

pragg continuing to be the comeback king amazing play he made this tournament extremely exciting was just glued to all his games and magnus also played really well at the start but i lost respect for him towards the end when in the interviews he just kept making excuses for his defeats and tried to discredit pragg completely he couldnt even look at pragg for even a second as he was speaking and looked so disinterested the least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so its not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him rlly left a bitter taste but im soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring,positive

funny i had an english undergrad friend who would read books in one or two days while it took me weeks to finish the same book i once asked him how he did it and he replied dont think too much just let the book take you away if you feel like coming back to it for a deeper reading thats when youll read slowly and with a more analytical eye but not every book will be worth it and sometimes you might not be ready for a deeper run through it so no point in forcing it i kinda get it because when i was learning english i would read books in english without understanding most of it at the end of the book i understood what it was about even though i didnt get everything but i just have a bad habit of wanting to know everything and get everything right the first time hello perfectionism my old friend when i read a piece of high literature or a historyphilosophy book i have to read and reread a paragraph until i feel like i got it i never enjoy the ride and thats why ive been reading less this video is a good reminder to just turn off and let the book carry you you always pick up something even if you dont realize it,neutral

the sorrows of young werther is a fabulous book despite the tragicromantic style it is not only based on goethes own disappointing experiences with women but also based on a friend who committed suicide after a woman he was in love with rejected him im no expert on goethe but i also understand he completed the colour wheel which isaac newton started it is important to understand that in goethes time there was a romantic movement nothing to do with the definition of the word today but rather as best described as the counter enlightenment goethe was an early proponent of its ideas and was part of a group in the late 18th c called sturm und drang storm and stress a small group including schiller of angry young men who embraced the ideals of the romantic movement by the way if you havent done a video on the romantic movement please do the romantics embraced much of the opposite of what they saw in the enlightenment such as science and rationalism and its clinical dry detached way of categorising humanity and the world the romantics were not an organised group as such one of the best descriptions of the romantics was written by my old philosophy teacher the declared aim of the romantics was to tear down the artifices of culture and rationality which barred the way both historically and personally to a return to nature this is nature the unbounded wild and everchanging nature the sublime and powerful were humans to behave naturally freed from the artificial constraints of cultural convention and morality then it was proposed that the truth of human life would be revealed and humans could live a nobler life in the name of nature the romantics worshipped liberty power love violence imagination irrationality the greeks the primitives or anything that aroused their emotional responses while in actuality they worshipped emotions as an end in themselves,neutral

as a game developer i have always taken the boring stuff incredibly seriously if you want to maximize efficiency when developing your game you have to work on your framework before you even try working on the entire games campaign or whatever else in fact and i discovered this the same way you did mark by building that framework often times you will accidentally end up building an mvp or demo at the same time i did this as well im still working on my first game but just recently i started closing in on the final lines of code for my unreal engine 5 framework that i will be using for my current game and all future titles in the franchise until my studio moves to a proprietary engine whenever we get the resources to pull it off as in when im not the only employee well im working on my framework and i look at the level ive built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added and i realized i basically just built a prealpha demo for my game all i need is to make the level actually look good because my level design skills are awful and i basically now have a prealpha project its funny how that can happen sometimes either way i always take this stuff seriously frameworks are everything in my opinion having a solid framework with abstract tools that you can basically just take and drop anywhere will make your life so much easier since you can basically just plug it into any project you start and just run with it,neutral

ive had both iphone and android and one of the key factors of me deciding to stay with iphone was that you can always rely on them to put their newest ios on every device the only company that can use ios is also apple so theres not 5 different companies doing their own thing and its up to you to figure out which android device is best additionally apple may be late to the party with certain things but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know its going to work significantly better than the competition apple may be more costly but id rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway,positive

so a bonsai could theoretically become a normal huge tree when planted elsewhere but the question is is a tree “happier” when it grows way bigger or is the tree happy when it’s small too the obvious answer is no the tree doesn’t care another answer would be “we have no way of knowing” people like to assign emotions to things but a lot of the time those emotions are just selfreflection people assign the wrong emotions to animals too even though we know animals can feel emotion people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly this happens all the time so even when we find out trees can experience emotion and some evidence already suggests this we would probably still force our own perspective onto them like we do now what we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do with the conditions they are given are they “satisfied” being the tree that they are i don’t think trees know this concept i think people shouldn’t anthromorphise their idea of “succes and satisfaction” onto plants in fact people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who don’t need it the trees definitely don’t need it either,negative

some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans that is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology they might just as well have asked if dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves or even if americans came from europe why are there still europeans just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes what we know is that the first apes evolved in africa about 25 million years ago from a population of old world monkeys whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the tops of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment for apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it at one time there were about 30 different species of apes in those forests had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole african continent however conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier as a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the african savanna with just a few scattered trees the shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct then about 6 or 7 million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna all apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly that savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about 4 mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans that gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel they did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened the apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change they became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them it set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us,negative

tip always start with reviews you can mix up their themes maybe one review didnt do this but the other didsee whats been strongly estbalished thru time and check if theyve mentioned controversial parts or gaps of your topic from this check recent past five yearjournals about these gaps and where do they stand also literature review is quite overwhelming at first given the large amount of information youre gonna see especially for the younger generation given their access to scihub which can put you in a psychological rut not just to comfort you but also as a professional tip— you dont need to write everything you know or everything about the topic coherence and transition that will support why your doing a specific study is more important moreover sufficient if you see an underlying pattern in terms of method or conclusion lets say among 35 studies try to explain this pattern in 1 paragraph you dont need to write how those authors got the results in detail unless you see a clash between two papers then maybe you can reevaluate their differences in method,neutral

i love your channel the technical details are perfect i’m an engineer and i work with batteries as a hobby there are two kinds of batteries that are lion one is “protected” and the other is “unprotected” the protected ones prevent overcharging and overdischarging as well as over current the unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection guess which people choose for their vaping lithium ion batteries have a huge energy density they are damaged by over charging and over discharging cheap chargers don’t behave and will over charge few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge so why don’t people use protected cells generally those have too low current to make vaping possible the current draw to instantly heat to 200c is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in causing things to not work or work much more slowly,positive

sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25 crores for a movie even highly educated proffesionals cas engineers doctors civil servants etc do not earn this kind of money in india after 10 year of service a simple logic if theses actors including the kumars khans devgans kapoors roshans etc start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price these superstars have built their mansions worth 100 crores and secured the lifes of their children and grandchildren they are living kingsize life with our hard earned money i believe we better stick to ott or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on youtube or any other app,negative

the only reason i wanted to learn more about quantum physics is because i was listening to dr tyson’s podcast where he mentioned quantum entanglement and that einstein didn’t think it was a thing calling it “spooky action at a distance” now my brain is a contradiction in terms in that i’m mathematically challenged seriously algebra might as well be sandscript but i understand calculus i’ve never found anyone that explain this to me lol so when dr tyson was explaining quantum entanglement i got the concept but i needed more info like trying to understand how an engine works by looking at the fuel fill and exhaust pipe and i know i’m just some guy but after reading everything i could get my hands on that wasn’t written for phd candidates it dawned on me that this might be our ticket to the stars my physics teacher in hs said that the only natural force that humans can’t manipulate is gravity and we’d have to be able to manipulate it if we ever want to explore other solar systems but excuse my ignorance if we can figure out how to manipulate quantum entanglement we would have the means to sidestep the cosmic speed limit,neutral

apologies for not watching the whole video as a former student and a parent of students i know the system was broken long before common core i remember in college my english 1 teacher had to give me a grammar guide because i was so deficient on the basicsthough i did well in english all through school i had to take remedial math because my high school didnt prepare me for college coursesthough i graduated with the required credits things have gone down since i was a student and my kids had schools with very high standards but very low expectations that means there were a lot of advanced classes offeredlike calculusbut so many ways to accept failure they had to take history and social studies but only had to pass one the policy of no child left behind was an additional failure as it meant no one failed or was held back even though they wouldnt graduate on time kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted too much government involvement means teachers arent allowed to teach we have some phenomenal teachers who are underpaid with far too much nonteaching responsibility heaped on them schools arent just expected to educate students now theyve got to feed them clothe them teach them manners and how to get along look out for abuse deal with all their special needs and accompanying ieps head off bullying deal with allergies and medical conditions worry about gender identity and sexuality discipline fairly deal with helicopter parents check the boxes for college prep and deal with the everpresent worry over school shootings with all were expecting from schools and teachers its a wonder anyone goes into this profession or stays once they see the outlook common core like no child left behind is a great idea on paper that fails in implementation my kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were welleducated there was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students it meant even more testing for studentsto judge whether their teachers were up to the task at the same time they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do betterlike tenure they promoted the best teachers out of the classroom they took away teaching assistants due to the costs they increased class sizes and they started charter schoolswhich were experimental programs imagine if all those billions spent on common core were used to pay teachers moreand get out of their way,negative

yo this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was so i feel like i should clear a few things up first off to game devs who are just starting out dont attempt to do exactly what i did because it probably wont work out well and im not saying this because i think im smarter or better at game dev than you in all honesty im pretty average and tons of people couldve done a lot better in my shoes but thats just the thing not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that i had prior to this id been making 2d games and was quite familiar with coding so carrying that over to unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple i mentioned this in the video but ive seen too many comments in the vein of wow this was impressive i would never be able to do this which frankly makes me feel a little bad since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience i had and i dont want to discourage anyone who doesnt realize this so i just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2d games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions also everyone learns at their own pace in their own way and the rate at which that gets done doesnt really matter as long as youre able to learn what you needed to learn in the end within reason of course if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print hello world then we might have a problem so even if you have as much experience as i did there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time because ultimately it doesnt really matter how quickly youre able to learn how to make games as a game developer you develop games and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about not how quickly you can make them of course this mostly only applies if youre doing this as a hobby and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay you should probably worry a little more and on the other side of the spectrum to those who think this video was faked it wasnt lol as mentioned before i already knew how to make 2d games and how to program things arguably the hardest part of developing games because of that the focus of this video wasnt on that but rather applying what i knew to 3d games by learning 3d modelling animation and how to work with unity which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such but mostly this was just for shits and giggles since i find messing around with 3d games entertaining and i feel like people may be reading into it too much lol also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar but that was caused by how i usually record clips while video editing and not when im actually making the games so i just have a weird workflow and last thing to youtube why the fuck does this have 500000 views did the algorithm break i can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500000 views and this is definitely not one of them so if youre watching this go watch someone elses video or something this one has way too many views already,negative

okay this gonna be a long one sorry about that im french and theres an interesting fact about france its that we are brutally honest most other people dont like that so we are called arrogant rude obnoxious but we are not we are just honest and people dont like honesty when we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other its not because we cheat more than you its just because we honestly answered the questions youre probably wondering where im going with that well i was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other not staying friends with each other yadayadayada and i cant relate at all because it doesnt work like that here i still know a lot of female who were already friend in high school and im 40 whenever i see my mother or my girlfriend or my girl friends they are just friendly i dunno its probably only on screen but the number of time i saw in tv shows or movies a group of girls being friendly then as soon as one leave they all turn to bitch on this one thats something i never saw in france they bitch on her while she is here and she doesnt take it badly because she does the same so i was wondering why is that why are they still friends if its different for others then i realized because we are honest my female friends wont hesitate to look at each others and say wow girl you look like shit today didnt you put on weight recently maybe you should work out and for me thats a healthy relationship why does american males manage to stay friends because they trash talk each other because they are honest because they say things as they are yeah sometimes we have fallouts but we mend things why cant female american stay friends because they are sneaky they lie ooooh you look gorgeous girl you are so strong i envy you while not thinking any of that sooner or later in any relationship based on lie the truth will come out and its not going to be pretty,negative

my grandmother was born in 1944 she was the youngest of five children the village where she was born was located in communist controlled territory so the eamelas forces would regularly interrogate locals in case of any anticommunist activity her father decided it was best to stay neutral and simply cooperate with the communists then some guy in the village who had some dispute with him framed him for anticommunist activity the whole family my grandmother being just a few months old was transported to a prison camp set up by the eamelas for anyone accused of opposing them there they rounded up all the men and executed them my greatgrandfather was beheaded with an axe and his body was thrown into a well soon the prisoners were liberated and they returned to their homes my grandmother grew up without a father something which still deeply affects her to this day because of that she simply dismisses anything remotely leftwing because of all the trauma caused by eamelas the greek civil war is one of the darkest pages in greek history and you can still see how it has divided us,neutral

it would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel 16” model had where you can change the refresh rate up to 60hz not great but i would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if you’re viewing movies it sucks that apple has made that limitation but is that a limitation on the thunderbolt or soc  i feel that the argument that many people don’t use a dual monitor setup is not really true especially in the work place my sister uses dual monitors working from home and she uses one of those miniwork towers the thing that tempts me the most about the air is the weight portability and the amount of power given specific specs it’s more or less wellrounded however if i’m bumping up the storage and unified memory i wouldn’t be that far off from the m1 pro 14” macbook pro price strangely the 14” would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13” nonretina macbook pro  the only cool thing about that model is the upgradability but even that is a novelty that’s losing it’s veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to i’m hanging onto it as my backup computer really ought to start saving for a more uptodate laptop the smudging thing is annoying from what i see it’s an awesome color but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all besides the size portability and power not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that i’ve yet to experience at work i work with desktop towers and i’m used to the noise i suppose,negative

my theory here that plant creature could possibly be that fungus but in a more mutated form as seen previously in the missing persons and autopsy report videos whenever someone dies in the backrooms they get covered in this black coloured fungus this fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto mutating itself onto the dead body given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate 100 1000 or even millions of years at best and also given that how time passes strangely in the backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the informational video with the date 291990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished however it wasnt teleportation but instead time travel that researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the presentation video with the date 581990 when the alarm rang out and cctv footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by async so by this logic the whenever someone dies in the backrooms the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time the creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash as seen in kanes secret video of 9780415263573 this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed the driver wasnt able to push the brakes in time to stop the car thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage the driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there the fungus grew on him and later the entire room in its mutated form also it sounded like the creature was yelling out help in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room which was seen in the original found footage video and later the pitfalls video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of its last victims and in this case even its originator which is the driver its all just a theory which i just came up with dont take it canon lol,negative

hello how are you from my point of view the video is very good and quite didactic however if you want to reach an even wider audience considering that in most developing countries education is precarious and a significant part of the potential audience does not speak english i suggest 1 to associate the subtitles even if in english as this would allow those who do not master the language to provide the translation of the entire text or parts of them not well understood precisely by the lack of mastery 2 that the narrator speaks in a more leisurely way as this would also benefit the audience that has not yet mastered the language thanks for the attention thanks for the video and i wish all success to the simplilearn team,positive

great insight i got into data science right after college and really struggled to do so the fact that the data science job role is defined so differently at different companies made interviews really hard to prep for it felt like you need to be a jack of all trades and be well versed in data science data engineering and data analyst principles and it was just a lot to prep for plus a lot of roles require graduate degrees after i got a role i left after a year and transitioned into swe as like you said the expectations didn’t match the reality plus i was also at a toxic workplace i realized that i want to be in a role that is more welldefined and somewhat uniform across companies so if i need to look for a job later i’m not being restricted to only a subset of opportunities bc of the different definitions and requirements,neutral

very informative video i agree with many of your points and id like to add some of my own im a lead data scientist at an american unicorn 1 we dont really care about your background as long as you can code sql and python understand the fundamentals of statistics and can apply standard ml models your education might limit your progress later on but the basics are plenty enough for you to do well as an entrylevel data scientist 2 communication is really important we expect all new hires to be good on the technical side so what ends up being the most significant discriminator between high and lowlevel is how well you can understand whats being requested and whats important and communicate your results in a way that helps the business this is the number 1 thing i mention to my reports during 11s 3 many data science courses bas or masters dont teach sql or if they do its just basic stuff regardless of what your actual role as a data scientist will be sql will always be essential,positive

what i love about computer programming in particular is that unlike any other subject taught in schools this one forces students to use the creative and logical parts of their brains for once what every country needs for success is smart people that can come up with solutions so i believe computer programming is something that should be taught from early on in order to train young minds of course its not for everyone i know people who wont understand it no matter how they explain it to them but then again mindless memorizing is not for everyone either,positive

very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity but even heavier amounts of lead possibly 10000 times higher were in the average household during that same time period most paints contained extremely high levels of lead many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes most pencils had a high lead concentration hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil house roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water i could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile solder usually 6040 lead tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment so you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels to blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view,negative

thanks for the great content shane as a data scientist myself who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially given that my own engineering field had few jobs available one thing i have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route if you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline plus the skills you need as a data scientist you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot while traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth you end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do but without the specialized domain knowledge coming from an engineering discipline myself i was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways i have noticed the same with my other peers who also dont come from the traditional route i say this because i have met with a lot of nontraditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they cant break through they definitely can break through and thrive in this field they offer specialized insights you cant get through the traditional route so if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities like linguistics or english you can become a powerful data scientist with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied such as nlp if you are someone who comes from a stem field even better because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems all data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science but what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem address user needs and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model i dont mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off but i do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well,positive

a good video as always as a cs major myself this is actually finally a series where i can answer questions and stuff in the comment section just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info 1 there are also not versions of all the gates and or and xor become nand nor xnor respectively they are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate while they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts you often here people verbally nand and xnor when talking about logic so i think it is interesting to note even though this isnt computer engineering 2 while by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false this is often not the case when we actually look at real components because of power usage the opposite is often used generally the more common output is set to 0 3 0 doesnt actually mean nothing is flowing through for example we may set our 1 to 5 volts and our 0 to 23 volts this allows for us to have an off state at 0 volts we wouldnt want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off there are also other uses for this state but this may be covered in a future video,positive

how to solve the rubiks cube faster ► please read this before commenting i try to reply often but i dont get step x or it doesnt work is too unspecific and i cant help unless i know exactly what problem you have make sure you know the 4 moves 152 has the 4 moves and you have to be able to do this to understand what 4 moves means when i use it again later on common first layer problems step 1 2 if the side colors of the cross or first layer dont line up the way i showed it in the video then you need to redo it pay attention to all of the colors on one piece and dont just pick white pieces randomly i talk about this in the video how im trying to match the other colors of the white piece like whiteorange etc taking pieces out of the second layer step 3 at 533 i say you should already know how to do this i admit this is unclear you should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer if this does not make sense watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment common top layer problems step 4 if you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 5 there should be no problems here step 6 if you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 7 finish the 4 moves dont stop at 3 every time turn the bottom dont rotate the whole cube to get the next piece if it still does not work you need to reassemble the cube as solved why do i need to reassemble the cube randomly assembling the cube only has a 112 chance of being solvable if youve ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces then that can be the problem if stickers have been switched you will have to switch them back full example solve,negative

magical realism is not from colombia because the term is european in concoction however when european writers viewed the way latin american writers wrote they saw it as realism with a splash of magical they viewed these stories through a lens of exotification without realising that its all real and that its a description of the absurdities found in latin american societies if we think about what exotification is its about seeing whats mundane or normalized in one society and treating it as special or unique because one is not used to it its very much about ignorance and how what we dont understand can often appear magical as a result how these authors chose to tell the story is what mattered this is why magical realism in my opinion does not exist its a term created in ignorance and perhaps the literary term itself is the most magical part about the whole genre,neutral

i got a cool idea maybe have space pirate raids on your ship in order to keep track of them you would need to use your ships cameras to see where they are heading possibly trying to cut off specific parts of the ship with doors in order to allow you to get there in time to take them out if there is combat they could probably take a couple slots per chest if they get to it then retreat to their ship maybe its always flying next to your ship while you are being raided this could make flying through the world pretty dangerous as at any point pirates could come and raid you maybe there could be a whole security system that enemies have to get passed or maybe they could cut your power in half making you unable to escape until all are gone it could really make the game incredibly fun,neutral

i worked as a high school teacher for thirty years over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory learning style was just one of many nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories presented as facts demanding evidence and proof ever yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher so you had no choice at least whilst being observed i became quite cynical in the end because i realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their cv and each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one god forbid anyone would actually just leave the teachers to use their own experience education and intelligence,negative
i watch your videos for your real talks and you never disappoint keep going youve reminded me of what someone once said the mind is the man the poor is in it and the rich is it too this sentence is the secret of most successful investors i once attended similar and ever since then i have been waxing strong financially and i most tell you the truth the bulls have been in control of the market for more than a month they have managed to push the price by more than 100 the majority of this rally has been without a considerable correction begging the question if one is pending following the test of the critical 2k level one thing is certain nobody knows what is going on our leadership in the country couldn’t be any worse from the press to the feds they are all terrible they say you can’t time the market but this one was easy to see coming every man woman and child no matter the age needs financial assistance doesn’t matter if your young or old we all need the stimulus check checks asap thats the major reason why one have to invest in crypto but not only investing rather invest and trade your assets for the gains its unfair on how things have turned up to be due to inflation things has been so difficult but btceth trading has helped me maintain financial stability although i believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why i made huge profits with the help of mr james wilson he is a genius and that is why i always advise beginnersinvestors to trade with professionals like him so far i have been able to increase my crypto trading portfolio from day trading from 107 btc to atop 1301 btc with the accurate trading signal provided to me by james and im an attestant to the accuracy of his trading strategy you all in search of a way to recover your looses from the crash and accumulate more profits can reach out to him for mentorship and profitable trading system on ͳeiєɠɾαm jameswilson21 cheers thank me later,positive

im taking a few online ml tutorials and have a text book not related to the course and i have to say that it is very similar to what i did in econometric with regards to predicting the regression analysis in ml is the same as i did in econometric but i just i didnt use python to do it i was using stata but you could use r to do the same thing and now days im sure they are teaching python in economics at any rate even after taking econometrics and taking a ml course i still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful albeit i do recognize that ml is a large topic and the first part of learning ml that i am doing including the textbook all start off doing regression analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesnt use when they talk about ml and the other parts i have yet to get to like ai and neural networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about idk i often hear people say that ml is used for large datasets like at netflix google amazon or etc to help suggest something or something along those lines well thats all fine and good but i dont work at a company like netflix or google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill the other problem is that to use ml at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ml course that it is very complicated and wont go into thus kind of making the example of these fang companies almost useless in the short term and medium term when you learn about ml you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chartgraph with a line through it eg the trend line technically you could use excel to reproduce some of the things i have learned in ml so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating or other things in ml like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age salary and whether or not they bought a car you can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes 70k will they buy a car it will be based off a percentage of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not the problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes and real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc so it becomes hard to do your own projects in ml because they dont really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects most of the time the ml tutorials focuses on how to do the predicationtrend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using they just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset this is a huge issue if you want to try doing ml on your own data because they dont teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a smallmedium business or say your website has x amount of traffic etc im often left wondering how the ml regression analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter for example in my book they talk about using ml to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 57 factors but to be honest the housing sample is a great example but i often have trouble trying to think of a problem that i could create using ml to predict a result ie my own project also the examples often are intuitive like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be i dont even need data or run ml on it to know that it can get demotiving at times so the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true like predicting gas prices will be higher in the summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacationtravel during summer also they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter its 200 pages like that countless hours of videos from tutorials saying now of course the real life data will not look anything like this but you get the idea i am kind of stuck inbetween smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ml and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what i want im tempted to skip 20 hours or 200 pages ahead and dive into the neural networks but cant stop thinking that maybe regression analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way will be helpful in the ai section or whatever so far its like learning basic statistics but in python,neutral

10308 since we are talking about mines i wanted to ask you how you and the community feel about horizontal mines now i understand that the way that the terrain functions this is simply just impossible with your way of digging which is better for pit mines which i love because they leave a large impact on the world but it can be quite difficult to mine in very mountainy terrain as the slopes become too steep very often that is why i thought that perhaps we could have some sort of structure like a mineshaft entrance that would then allow your camera to get underground and for you to mine shafts with a line tool like how paths are made and hopefully fences in the future there could be various widths for technologies in the future like extra wide shafts for minecarts or tunnels with trains perhaps but that is far later into development you could also have parts that would allow you to make stair or ladder rooms to go up or down a level to make more compact or deeper mineshafts the way the terrain works currently actually really works with with that level system as when your dig out a secondary entrance it will be on a level already to match the tunnel networks a major issue with this though is how the camera system would work i could imagine a top down view working pretty well when building the tunnels however i feel like that might not fit the game i wouldnt have an issue with it but others may of course you can always do your standard 1st person view to walk around the mines if you want to but that wouldnt work when trying to make mineshafts i think edit i guess maybe you could still do your 1st person view if you could somehow make it look like you were actually underground and not just floating under the world and seeing through the ground another thing i thought of though is that this system would actually allow you to dig below sea level as all you would need to do is not render water underground i say that as if it is easy when i actually know hardly anything about game development but i do believe that should be achievable but going far underground would allow you to find metals that you normally wouldnt which i think would be cool of course it would probably be behind some kind of research that would allow you to brace your tunnels or something to prevent collapse,neutral

to the people saying that growing bonsais is torture i just want to say that many of the training methods are also applies in other tree nurseries where the trees for parks streets and gardens are grown they are repotted pruned the roots too wired and they get limited amounts of nutrients in order to grow into the desired shape of course it isnt neccessary to keep bonsais at such a small size when the trees could become much bigger but as long as they are kept healthy i dont see a problem with it i think that few wild trees actually have the resources to grow to their full potential and especially not the ones that grow in urban settings,neutral

hi priya thank you for this video i am concluding my last year as a student receiving my bs in data analytics and i have so many questions that are causing me anxiety as i am nearing the end of my journey i have realized that the path in computer science dsda is not structured like one probably imagined it would be what i am wondering is if you encountered the same during your journey in terms of learning these program tools python sql tableau r if what’s important while in school is getting a basic understanding of these tools and how to use them but the real challenge starts after graduating in teaching yourself on how to use these tools more effectively to actually be able to draw meaningful insights did you have to hone your skills a bit more once you graduated before you started to apply to jobs i have beginner level on all these programs right now but i feel like i probably won’t be able to land a job in data analytics until i’m at least intermediate in sql and at least python for starters i would appreciate your feedback and would also love to connect with you offline to chat if possible congratulations again on your journey and your role in data science,negative

imo something thats extremely underrated especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on observer pattern is a must for game dev with larger projects having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects and it makes your code more modular each classgame object is its own self contained thing singleton and factory patterns as well as solid principles are also good to look into factory less so for unity since you can use getcomponent to retrieve references for things if youre using unity learn to use unity eventsc events and you will make your code a lot cleaner and save time on large projects,positive

my grandfather actually played with bobby regularly in 1956 at the west orange chess club in new jersey they played on the same team in interstate tournaments i found some of my grandpa’s old letters and it’s pretty cool he won multiple chess championships some amateur and some professional in the late 40s and early 50s he also was involved in a few professional chess clubs and magazines he was born in 1909 and while i like to think he taught bobby a thing or two to help him gain his immense success that year it’s likely the 13 year old schooled my grandpa my grandpa quit chess in 1957 to turn professional in bridge because it was better financially chess tournaments didn’t pay well back then though he probably played teenage bobby enough to know he stood no chance in the future if a 13 year old made a multitime champion quit the game entirely he must have been truly special my grandpa could card count so i don’t think he had a problem switching to bridge and became a national life master in bridge and had a successful career i never got to meet him because he died before i was born i’m only 23 i would’ve loved to ask him about bobby maybe my mom knows a bit more all i have are letters and a few chess trophies it’s very hard to collect information from the early 50s,positive
