the problem i have with those overly stressful education systems is that i wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them what i learned through selfdefense practice and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus and are not an effective way to learn in selfdefense instructors increase stress by making you do cardiobased exercises to make your body artificially feel stress accelerated heartbeat difficulty to breath difficulty to focus only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal but they dont do it for learning purposes the military seems to do it too in their own way i would also point out that every doctor in the world with common sense would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue its funny how the little girl in the video who had an allegedly stressfree education in kindergarten was able to catch up with her classmates in a few months i wonder how the students who went through this type of education system would perform against students from other countries here in france we dont have that type of education system nor in the united kingdom i studied for 2 years at a british university,negative

i was impressed by how more often than not that it actually felt like people interacting onscreen and not cgi hulk animations the montageaction in most cgi scenes i feel use so much motion blur that theyre justwellblurry there was a bit of that here but overall its becoming more naturalistic dig it eyes flicker and the uncanny valley is usually from the need to add every frame between the movements for smoothness when there isnt much smoothness at all to eye movement they did a good job with the eyes for sure this has nothing to to with much of what was covered in the video but just throwing in 2 cents,positive

1038 just an extra note about using sha for passwords while it can be used its often not the best choice sha was designed to be fast to compute making it very useful for older hardware and things like signatures but you typically want the exact opposite for passwords for a password hashing algorithm you want it as slow as possible until it starts annoying users that way an attacker will be able to calculate fewer hashes per second while brute forcing as of right now the usual choices for password hashing are bcrypt or argon2id both of which were designed to be slow,neutral

ive been an edtech consultant in beijing for 7 years ive also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools there are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive the first and foremost factor i would note is the lack of public discourse this permeates through every part of society especially education if you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner inquiry and reflection in education this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge even in history class theres no critical thinking or reflection involved it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember the second factor of note is barriers of information the public does not have easy access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content and even if they did get access they wouldnt be able to recognize it on top of that there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as vipkids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations this causes market distortion and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name eg wonders and say thats their curriculum without any plan how to implement it the third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge as stated in the first point most of the populations education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection if youve been taught not to question things your whole life how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies how can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences the result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good or fishing consultants like me for free content the fourth factor is lack of foreign talent there are not enough qualified teachers to meet demand the general population would not be able to recognize one either many companies hire russians call them american and slap a 200 markup on the course its up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content instruction and meet the unrealistic expectations the decision makers sales people set for the parents the final factor is who the decision makers are who decides what national curriculum is starting in 2020 private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the national curriculum this topdown decision making only exasperates the situation it also permeates throughout the society ive been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools most of these decision makers are unqualified theyre sales people at best i should also mention that many parents have no clue about education yet influence the schools with their misconceptionsbut this is not the parents fault rather its the schools fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program as for price its simply about demand vs supply lack of foreign talent as mentioned before combined with a desperate middle class and higher trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost they will pay upwards of 200k rmb just to make it happen for their little middle schooler unfortunately i exited the market partially because the clients i had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problemsmostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum,negative

ai is the most important one a lot of people think ai is going to somehow mean self awareness consciousness at some point the main implications of ai is that it is self improving the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen is that ai is going to overtake humans in a lot of things including research and science it is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change everything about life far more than the industrial era did for example 300 years from now we can have an ai program that has been improving itself for 300 years we lose about 14 million people each year from car accidents and that is just fatalities there are also many more injuries so while i understand people being skeptical about machines driving cars as time goes on it is not even going to be close ai is going to be able to do many many things better than humans at some point these quantum computers are going to make ai they could program an ai to make a better ai of itself an improved version then the 2nd one can make a 3rd one that is better then it etc etc there is really no telling what this is going to do because we are not there yet but it is going to change things very rapidly when it happens,neutral

i love your videos i think you would be intrigued to hear or perhaps you are already aware that there is an ancient record that was unearthed in the 1820s in palmyra new york that was inscribed in reformed egyptian by ancient israelites they crossed over the seas from jerusalem around 600 bc and landed on what they described to be a narrow neck of land most likely in panama they left their records behind for us and their records spoke of jesus christ visiting them after his resurrection they multiplied their seed and spread north and south and fought many battles over the north and south american continents which were considered their new promised land thus the signs of christ written with hebrew origin that you examined would be accurate there is another record which has been discovered in panama much like the one discovered in palmyra new york it is a gold set of plates with ancient egyptian and hebrew origins as well perhaps you could examin the panama gold plates to see if they are authentic,positive

my sons were in chinese public schools until 8th and 9th grade respectively i am french and their mom and chinese so we thought it was important they at least attended a few years of school in the local system until the 6th grade the system does work and teaches them importance of hard work now as bicultural kids they were actually considered foreigners which in a way lessened academic pressure but also caused resentment especially for my older son from 6th grade onwards the pressure becomes pointless and is made worse because teachers and schools are incentivized on class results the worst of them will not hesitate to try and persuade weaker students to leave bullying by teachers can also occur my youngest son went all the way to the zhongkao and got accepted into a top local high school but then asked if he could go to an international school he went to a very selective one but probably has only half the workload of his former classmates this 2021 reform only focused on alleviating some financial burden what it didnt do is address some fundamental issues with the system teachers are not incentivized to help weaker students instead they push them out everything is based on 2 tests one in grade 9 and one in grade 12 these tests are extremely hard but also very narrow and focus on rote learning but do not do enough to help kids develop analytical skills even if that has improved a bit system should be reformed to take equivalent of gpa into account this would ease a lot of the pressure the last 5 years of high school are spent on passing 2 exams rather than help students grow there is a little that is learnt in those 5 years to help them transition to higher education yes most of them will have strong language and math skills but a lot of it is mechanical some families were using tutors to develop the analytical side of things so at least the ministry should also have reformed part of the curriculum,neutral

an important caveat is that when interviewing anyone you need to establish a “baseline” for their individual body language maybe they are naturally more nervous or nervous because of the situation so you first ask questions you already know answers to to see how they react watch how they move when they tell the truth figure out their “normal” then you can ask calculated questions and see if there is deviation you are looking for clusters of indicators not isolated indicators,neutral

as someone who studies convict leasing in tennessee this is a great video just a couple corrections 1 tennessee prisoners were not sent to birmingham they were leased to tennessee coal and railroad company its a little more complicated than that but we can go with that for simplicitys sake who used prisoners in their mines in tennessee after convict leasing ended in tennessee in 1896 tennessee coal and railroad moved its headquarters to birmingham and continued using forced prison labor there but those were alabama prisoners not tennessee prisoners 2 states absolutely used convict leasing to make money the lease on the tennessee state penitentiary could not be sold for less than 100000 per year beginning in the mid1880s that would be over 2 million per year in todays money 3 selling crops after sunset was specifically illegal as a means of controlling sharecroppers the idea was that sharecroppers might sell some of their crop outside of their contract with the landowner they would need to do it secretly so that the landowner didnt know and would probably do it at night to prevent witnesses hence why selling crops after sunset was illegal i am happy to provide archival documents for these facts if you are interested,neutral

i found this very interesting and as someone with adhdi i had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it it brought up so many points of interest with in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution adhd is considered an epidemic of our time and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking from the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses as time went on this idea continued but in a different way by the 1920s there was a drive towards raising the standards of living people were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked and live in the suburbs in a house get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style but like he said in the talk this type of trend doesnt work anymore styles of life are so divergent and its obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women arent going to be stay at home moms and many cant actually during the 60s many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life and as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living as for adhd it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child i believe adhd is both a cause and symptom of behavior but not always both take your eyes for example you get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly so you get prescription lenses you now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription and no one asks why no one asks why are you like this how did it happen or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it yes and no you can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors your nutrition your genetics and your life style actually some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight by changing their diet and their habits for instance a child who stays inside all day watching tv and playing videogames for hours refuses to eat his vegetables and whos parents or relatives have had glasses may develope near sightedness so in relation a child who has been mentally watching tv and playing videogames all day not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity exploring their real world developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating interacting socially with others around them making constant decisions based on logic real feelings and experiences and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner and it doesnt just go for adhd this could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty in varying degrees of course but it is believed that behavior in any form is partially learned and partially developed and by developed i mean the way your brain developed how your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works going back to education you can see why this factory mind set cant work for everyone as well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts you find contradiction most people dont understand the arts most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesnt make sense anymore truth is that area of education evolved but only by those who pursue it would understand a big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world the a grade is the pinacle of that idea do perfectly in your education and you get an a well this doesnt really work in the art world you still get graded when you do your work and do it well but school is for practicing the academics in art you study academics as well like art history art theory and your use of a medium like drawing or painting what you dont get graded on is on the things that cant be measured like your idea your creativity and the value of your work though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill but when it comes right down to it art isnt about any of this or it can be about all of it it can be about how others value your work it can be about how divergent your work seems to be it can be about how well your work matches a subject it can be about how well you use methods of design it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic aka art competition or auction so in a way it is chaotic to the point people cant make sense of it any more but it is not inherently measurable and perfected it is the product of ideas and ideas are valued above all else and yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty,positive

house of the dragon is inspired by georges book called fire and blood which tells the story of what was known as one of the most violent wars and power struggles within the game of thrones universe the tragic fight was called the dance of dragons and this event takes place 100 years before daenerys the funny thing about the book is that it is a kind of book within the universe itself thats because the dance of dragons was a historical event and when reading the book as it is written the impression one gets is that any inhabitant of westeros could go to the library and read the same book telling about what led to the dance of the dragons to happen and yes it was just a book that tells about this event and it is already finished so for the series we can expect less seasons than got and a more complete story different from the ending of got that was not written by george since the books still are not finished but all the characters of house of the dragon were created by him as well as the basis of the story although some things can and will have some changes hope i helpedxx,neutral

this was a lovely event worth it for the acting alone especially the remarkable rendition of the scene of eves awakening i do think the debate was played too much on shakespeares terms and turf in part because prof smith politely allowed it to stay there some thoughts biographical silence favours shakespeare about whom we know relatively little than milton whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss weakness aspiration perseverance hatred and love this was hardly raised so too historical context shakespeare comes clearly out of an elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like marlowe and codeveloped by writers like jonson milton obliterates the norms of mid17th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism drama favours interiority and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness milton and most literary history would not have thought it so though the actors brilliantly depicted ms dramatic imagination in paradise lost his goal unlike shakespeares was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind but to go beyond them his theme is not finally the human but the humaninthecosmos in short we judged here whether milton was better according to the criteria of shakespeare shakespeare will win that battle with anyone milton will sooner decline your crown and force you to ask whether youre asking the right questions in the first place,positive

this lecture is awesome and really inspiring ive been a fan now for years now lex and im really happy to see your success i just wanted to point out that i believe your analysis of one shot learning re human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base the learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling sitting up and standing up this process takes usually between 1 and 2 years this time and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible the process can be accelerated through coordinationspecific training on the part of the parents which occurs quite often errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road eg requiring knee replacement at 55 bipedalism is pretty complex and is way harder than quadrupedalism which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim,positive

its two different things to start learning and to make your first serious game when you start learning if you go straight away to make your dream game it will likely be frustrating because you have a vision of the game in your head but you can barely translate any of that vision into an actual game creating a copy or a remake of an already existing game that you like is a good way to learn when i started learning unity some years ago after doing a few tutorials i decided i would create a remake of duke nukem 3d using some of the assets of duke nukem forever and remaking the first level of the game in blender this was so that i could focus mainly on the coding side of things and put the creative part of it aside for the project it took me i believe 6 months to finish it it had all the basic game mechanics and the first level of the game and yes it played terrible and nothing like the original but the amount of learning i did thanks to this learning project was really a lot i dont think i could have learned faster other way another point i would mention is learning to code i think was the most important thing i did when i started making games my game ideas were limited to what i imagined i would be technically capable of implementing after i got a good grasp of coding i feel and i know i could make anything i can imagine given the time to do so,neutral

summary notes 0000 intro the problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information the second brain system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information the second brain system has helped ali in his own life and can hopefully help others as well the second brain system uses code as an acronym to explain its core foundations capture organize distill express 0041 what is a second brain and why should you have one a second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas building a second brain can help you express your creativity be more productive and make better decisions every job today involves knowledge work of some kind and a second brain can help you with inputting processing and outputting information the methodology for building a second brain has four parts capture organize distill and express code 0456 c capture ali discusses different ways of capturing information both manually and automatically ali captures his thoughts and ideas in apple notes he also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books articles and podcasts having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day as well as highlights from books articles and podcasts 0832 o organise ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in ones learning this means that when you come across something relevant you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take rather than creating a new category for it you can still search for specific information using control f or command f if needed this system is especially helpful when working on longterm projects with many moving parts 1107 d distill ali talks about a method called progressive summarization which is basically like highlighting but on steroids this is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important different than highlighting were used to in school its not particularly effective for retention in your own personal brain but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important 1145 e express the e in the second brain system stands for express meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas you need to share them with the world in some way sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback collaborate with others and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work without expressing our ideas they are essentially useless its important to find a way to share your creativity with others 1309 how my second brain has helped ali the coursebook has helped ali become more productive but also more creative and less stressed in general the system taught ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one most of the work is already done the system has also helped with his teaching work he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information,positive

personally i think education or specifically a lack thereof is one of the strongest driving forces behind things like this because ignorance breeds fear and distrust especially in things that are new or foreign when i was in elementary school back in the 70s i was reading my way through my schools scifi section it was just a few shelves but it had almost all the classics asimov bova bradbury campbell clarke doc smith heinlein and then i got to verne id just finished up 30000 leagues and was getting into journey to the center of the earth when i found a page had been ripped from the book being a good student i reported it to the librarian but instead of focusing on the missing page she was outraged that i was reading this particular book it was above my level she said and too difficult for me this was a hundredyearold story at this point and i was pretty sure it wasnt a difficult one to follow the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on creature feature on saturdays but she still took the book away and over the next few weeks that scifi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there a short time later i overheard her talking to another teacher about of all things a shooting star a meteor that many had seen a night or two before the librarian was mocking the teacher because a shooting star is impossible the heavens are permanent the stars dont move as the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor it seemed to both terrify and outrage her and the longer that conversation went on the more even i maybe 10 or 11 years old at the time realized the scifi books she had removed werent above my level they were above her level she had no understanding of science and all these scifi stories about starships robots and alien worlds were things that she just didnt understand and because of that they scared her so she locked them away and unfortunately it sounds like that sort of mindset hasnt changed all that much in the 40 or so years since then,negative

i have a decent amount of physical games from the original xbox 360 and one so i feel justified getting the series x especially because it has superior fps at 4k resolution the problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series x to its limits yet if you still have a one x and plan to get a series x later and can wait you can update the internal hdd to a sdd on the one x it’ll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the series s the one x has a better graphics card than the series s previous games optimized for the one x will look better on the one x than on the series s however cross platform games are probably going to have a better fps than the x do to the better cpu there’s a lot that goes into this stuff another factor to consider is the quality of your tv i’ll be looking to pair my series x with a new oled tv here soon and then i’m 200 sure i’ll feel justified with the purchase also i game a lot so 30 60 120 frames a second… i notice the difference and in no way shape or form would i feel justified having a next gen console series s that can’t even keep up with my old 4k tv,positive

summary machine learning is the general term for when computers learn from data there are lots of different ways algorithms that machines can learn the algorithms can be grouped into supervised unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms the data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be inputoutput pairs or just inputs supervised learning algorithms require inputoutput pairs ie they require the output unsupervised learning requires only the input data not the outputs here is how in general supervised algorithms work you feed it an example input then the associated output you repeat the above step many many times eventually the algorithm picks up a pattern between the inputs and outputs now you can feed it a brand new input and it will predict the output for you here is how in general unsupervised algorithms work you feed it an example input without the associated output you repeat the above step many times eventually the algorithm clusters your inputs into groups now you can feed it a brand new input and the algorithm will predict which cluster it belongs with the first example in this video used the knearest neighbor algorithm which is a supervised machine learning algorithm hope that was useful to someone thanks for the video really enjoyed it,neutral

here is the transcript the literature review is not an essay it is not a research paper the literature review is part of your essay the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe standalone product if youre masters degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for but regardless of whether part of the research essay or standalone product one thing the literature review does not do is it doesn’t prove state illustrate collaborate or develop your main point thats in the body of your essay the literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper well what the heck does it do then well the literature review is divided into the following key terms first is the whole idea of what the heck in the literature the literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic now remember i said narrow topic we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic thats the first thing that you need to know the literature is published peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic second thing the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed what the heck of a review well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it what is that snapshot going to capture that snapshot going to capture major concepts the major point the major outcome the major whatever in that source it’s not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot once you get all those snapshot done you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of timeline situation maybe not but the key years is you’re going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element may be on a time line type of situation now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why theyre hack are you doing all this stuff well i think there are three reasons probably why youre doing all this stuffs in school in the first one off course to improve your own understanding as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding build your background build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline then in of course in this paper when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject youre going to be demonstrating that knowledge demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment but you know the real purpose of a literature review is it’s a reader service it something you doing as a favor for your readers what are you doing you are bringing them up to date what’s the first thing you and that old friend do you ask each other hey what you been doing all these years fill me in update me you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in you updating them by bringing them up to date then you can start at the present again you see what i’m saying you can bring them along that timeline of the path letting them know the key element the major concepts the key element in your life and what you dare boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literatures review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas past scholars the past researchers boom and then come your idea,negative

i feel you on the cost of the pro series controller i have one of the series 1 pro controllers which i bought used and frankly i was disappointed that after i had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel i had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there because xbox doesnt offer their own replacement parts which i find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue to be honest i would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isnt going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time the paddles are nice and all but i can buy like 3 games for the cost or i can buy a third party controller from scrub for less and get the same functionality out of it but hey to each their own what i would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab i would pay extra for that but as it stands right now ill stick with my standard series x controller ,negative

the biggest thing ive realized lately is that the more money you have the more money you will want to spend so you never really feel like you have enough thats why i really like the idea mentioned in this video of learning how to be satisfied with what you already have this is especially true of us in the first world we get carried away by envy and comparison and believe the lie that other people live happier lives than us because they have all this stuff that they are living the dream but the fact is that the only reason they have all this stuff is because they are stressed out all the time trying to maintain their excessive lifestyles and if they stopped pushing to get more and more stuff then they would realize that happiness was already within their reach the irony is that people in the third world that come to live in the first world have a tendency to become like this the most they have lived their whole lives in poverty feeling envy for those in the first world who have everything they need so when they come to live here and get a job they carry their envy with them and buy into the lie that they need more and more stuff their family back home wonder why they are so stingy in sending money but the family doesnt realize that the cost of living is much higher where we live you never feel like you have enough,positive

i think anyone who has spent time working in a modern agile corporate environment could tell you the crux of the problem in an instant we no longer plan past the next quarter supply chain bottleneck is just another way of saying that we let the beancounters run the show and they were good at it right until something happened which they could neither model nor predict cerveza the system is brittle by design because its so much cheaper that way nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos its a huge engineering lift it takes 20 years to pay itself off you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts machine them weld them then certify and maintain them over a period of 40 years instead weve been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home gutting workforces funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain skill loss as the old timers machinists retire but hey we delivered a lot of value for shareholders and now the chickens are coming home to roost,negative

i sincerely appreciate the work youve done and the knowledge you share technical analysis can be helpful but i think it is quite puzzling that wellknown cryptocurrency youtubers just pay attention to pure ta and entirely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is inflating and why the outlook for the future is even more encouraging than it seems ignoring the reality that each etf launch to this point has caused a sizable decline from btc highs is somewhat dangerous we were already in a perilous position and only survived a protracted bear market due to historically low volume and nearly whale pumps day trading should be given greater consideration because it is less affected by the markets situation trading daily with libertoncorp i have earned over 12btc using his insights and charts his insight has always been a step ahead of others,neutral

honestly that tricolour three team mode was what sold the game to me its just a shame that its limited to splatfests only i felt like as a mode that was the truly unique and franchisepushing idea of a mode that warranted a whole sequel oh well i guess nintendos servers wouldnt be able to handle it at the moment this is just what splatoon 2 should have been back in 2017 to me splatoon really needs to evolve beyond the first game in quite tremendous or advanced ways in order to actually feel like a true sequel the tricolour mode was close to that principle but alas its only limited to splatfests otherwise stay fresh is just a quote of sheer irony because splatoon has thus far to me not proven to stay fresh,negative

my underestanding is that the wife wasnt going to survive either way so it was a matter of letting the gods take them both or actively killing his wife to save the baby an absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it weve seen some horrible stuff but her death scene was up there with one of ramsays scenes i also think given recent political events in the us it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from marvel not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come also i hear this series will be far more morally grey than game of thrones ever was daemon gives me ramsay or joffrey vibes but hell be much more complex and less villainous while he seems to operate on selfmotivation his violence isnt wanton or random like joffrey or ramsay so i picture him being closer to a cerseijaime style character but if anything he absolutely gives peak targaryen vibes and matt smith gives a stellar performance im really excited to see corlys valaryon and rhaenys targaryen a shame we havent seen much of rhaenys but i picture her having some of cerseis chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown i hate to touch on this but i know corlyss racial change was of concern and i originally had slight concern myself not because some omg woke bs but because of the velaryons and the targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation so i prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one but if you think about it the light complexion of the targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins furthermore valyria was awfully close to the summer isles and sothoryos so to me corlys is more what i would envision the original valyrians would look like so it doesnt bother me in the slightest especially after seeing him on screen he seems like a great character already and i think and hope hes up there with davos otto hightower gives strong tywin and littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all he does seem like a type of manofhonor but more in the sense of being a strict rulefollower stuck in the old ways and then obviously viserys is the ned stark of the series i love seeing that name reclaimed and while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity im glad he apologized to rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her i especially like that when brought up with the council the first response was theres never been a queen but one of the others was quick to chime in with only out of precedent and tradition its nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has hah but shes a woman maybe rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had also while the age difference between him and alicent is a little insane and i dont like otto pimping out his daughter like that i do think they would legitimately treat each other well probably erring on the side of viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it most of all the show felt like we jumped straight into s3 or s4 of game of thrones,negative

i know at least 5 ways to deal with them 1 never take their words personally always have this suspicion in mind that they do not wish good for you so you shouldnt trust their opinion of you 2 dont compete with them it is futile and drains your energy 3 if they attack you stay calm indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment the odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative 4 dont become them if they are negative be positive if they lie tell the truth if they speak behind your back speak to their face always lead with example because they might not simply have the skills to do that 5 do not trust them dont tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you keep your distance and value your boundaries protect yourself,negative

i agree with the sermas comments regarding casemiros age but this whole 30 is the new 25 is very subjective and depends on the player luckily casemiro happens to be a player that looks after himself well and is very particular about how he trains and what he eats his injury record is phenomenal as well however not every player ages like casemiro modric ronaldo etc some lack the training and nutritional ethic and often retire 1 or 2 years after 30 so whereas its objectively true that sports science and nutritional science in general has come a long way that doesnt mean that every player is taking equal advantage of it some dont even have the opportunity to do so players like eden hazard sergio busquets are good examples of the counternarrative in my opinion on his goals casemiro is really good at set pieces and his movement inside the oppositions box is very good great aerial ability as well all in all real should be glad that they didnt lose him without tchouameni already recruited good luck tank,neutral

i did my undergrad in computer science and im finishing up my ms in computer engineering it always drives me nuts when people ask what i do and then assume either is just programming or software engineering i try to explain it like this computer science is centered around mathematicscomputational science and problem solving developing algorithms and optimization programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems computer engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems i always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took computerelectrical engineering as undergrads because they generally speaking are simply trying to make x thing work and i am trying to make x thing run as efficient as possible you can take several different paths to become a coder but theres very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines anyone looking at going to school for computer science should understand this you are learning to be a problem solver first coding is secondary anyone can learn to code but being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career if you go down this path you are going to be doing far more math than coding and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code you will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts libraries and frameworks but those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use i hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into,negative
the reason they said large and open space instead of largest map is because if you look at their past games and you measure the square footages of every location and put them together that may be bigger none of their past games have had an open world their other games usually have one big world segmented into multiple locations in this game its actually one open world so its the largest open space of any game they created and they did say that this open world is bigger than prey,neutral

great video you did great explaining this that said i would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps specifically data acquisition and cleaning mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research furthermore it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found do some field work say nsf or an ffrdc gives you 2 million dollars for it go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you don’t figure out until your back oh well this seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies all the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned the first two steps acquisition and cleaning are so important,positive

so theres been some conversations here about my use of the term viking and who it refers to i think its important to start off by saying that these videos arent made for universitylevel history buffs or the like theyre designed for people trying to learn about historical periods they know little about or are revising for exams alevels gcses etc since i base my videos where applicable on british teaching standards i think its important to note that that the use of the term viking and scandinavian are allowed to be used interchangeably at this level at the level of a bachelor or masters degree absolutely not that level of historical nuance isnt required here yes the technicalities of historical analysis demand that certain terms be used only under specific circumstances but not here these videos arent for indepth historical analysis nor do they claim to be a definitive history of the viking age the people commenting that viking was not used accurately are largely correct however in the context of who this video is for it matters more that other information is included and those watching not be bogged down by technicalities these videos are here to build a foundation from which people can research further there are other channels if youd like indepth and dry discussions of terminology anyway i hope you all enjoyed the video,neutral

hi everyone i realized i didnt actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games thats why ethical monetization is my specialty now so for sure theres data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions it also encompasses monetization and systems design though i wasnt formally trained in monetization design before joining its actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first monetization design encompasses things like battle passes loot box designs game ecoystem design hard currency to soft currency what resources are tradable and purchasable etc designing events and seasons what content should be available how is it distributed what does progression and rewards look like in an event etc and ofc the pricing of it all we also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones we often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction purchase regret mau revivals etc to get a sense of this my role today though focuses on a broader list of things not just monetization but particularly engagement and retention as well i made a video about what the responsibilities are so feel free to check that out,positive

germany acted foolishly when decommissioning so much nuclear when it was providing so much clean energy their co2 emissions would likely be much lower if they kept them around plus they would have more energy independence personally i am a big fan of nuclear as it provides the kind of reliable concentrated energy production that fossil fuel based systems offer but without the emissions renewables require so much land and raw materials and produce relatively small amounts of energy compared to nuclearfossil fuels i would far rather have a nuclear power plants replace existing coal and gas plants using the same small plots of land with renewable it requires covering vast amounts of land with solarwind in order to collect the highly defuse energy source that is windsolar this land should be used for farming or nature preserves not renewables if the solar is using worthless land such as the desert maybe it makes senses but that has its own problems of longer transmission lines and more frequent cleaningmaintenance needed due to the dust offshore wind also resolves the land use problem but the costs of maintaining 100s of windmills in the extremely harsh ocean environment are very high not to mention ruining the view of ocean front properties,neutral

lets look at this from a consumer point of view paying developers a fee for timed exclusive is one thing no big deal thats just how the business is obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console but for sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially bribe multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay full price on there platform instead because they know they cant compete with it is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get and they have the nerve to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry  talk about the pot calling the kettle black  sony has no answer to gamepass there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they cant go anywhere else this is simply sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from cod but i guarantee if sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldnt leave cod multiplatform its apparently one rule for everyone else but completely another for sony  hypocrisy at its best,negative

first of all let me clear up the misunderstanding about why asians do well in life we do not always send kids off to academic supplements sat study classes etc obviously there are those parents are ultimately force their child to go but there are a plethora that do just as well if not better on these types of activities sat act gpa school etc without any additional help aside from a practise test book from the local library that is me and i can affirm that for many asian kids we have an inherent need to do good make our parents proud no matter how much pressure we have and have a highlevel job and go to ivy league schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us we push for the best because of our work ethic not because all asians have oh so much money for the majority of our parents as immigrants it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour the hard work the exhaustion and the prejudice they have faced in the past all to provide their children with more opportunities it is not that asians are inherently smarter or richer or more privileged in any ways although there are those select few but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today asians are no different from others of ethnic origin to say mexicans africanamericans indians and other disprivileged minorities in the states the only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end i am not trying to start up any racial slurs cursing or insultations of any kind just putting out a thought and consideration for you all obviously there are many successful talented and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones but i am just making a point here why would the highlevel universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of racial preference or racial advantage note i put that in quotations meaning i myself do not think that is a fact there are hardworking and lazy people smart and ignorant good and bad in any race it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public so tell me why should one race get more sympathy or preference over another can we not just all be equal human beings it is like saying red is better than pink why oh because it is true without an explanation so what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me due to how personal it felt as a 10th grade chinese girl and i wanted to share the truth to everyone thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully we can all start changing society little by little with messages like this no enmities i hope,positive

more ram being allocated to game devs is nice but it doesn’t solve one of the biggest issues of the series s which is the bandwidth of the memory itself also more ram doesn’t really mean higher frame rates but higher quality textures or assets or increase the distance before you see lod culling it isn’t going to affect frame rate by going from 30 to 60 but it might allow a stuttering inconsistent 30 fps to hold a more locked 30 fps,negative

sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25 crores for a movie even highly educated proffesionals cas engineers doctors civil servants etc do not earn this kind of money in india after 10 year of service a simple logic if theses actors including the kumars khans devgans kapoors roshans etc start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price these superstars have built their mansions worth 100 crores and secured the lifes of their children and grandchildren they are living kingsize life with our hard earned money i believe we better stick to ott or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on youtube or any other app,negative

some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans that is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology they might just as well have asked if dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves or even if americans came from europe why are there still europeans just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes what we know is that the first apes evolved in africa about 25 million years ago from a population of old world monkeys whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the tops of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment for apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it at one time there were about 30 different species of apes in those forests had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole african continent however conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier as a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the african savanna with just a few scattered trees the shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct then about 6 or 7 million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna all apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly that savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about 4 mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans that gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel they did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened the apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change they became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them it set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us,negative

here i am employed as a developer watching a video that purports to be for beginners and its a great video so far one of the things i love about approaches like this is that especially for developers like me who just picked up some crap over time and am doing stuff with it there are lots of fundamentals that slip through those autodidactic cracks for instance i know what statelessness means generally but then at around 2330 craig explains not only clearly but completely enough for the contextwith no extraneous details nice work,positive

hi just want to say that many times ruminating is emotionally driven… there can be an uncomfortable feeling and our mind jumps in to try to either make us feel better or dwell on that feeling and feed more into it so shifting from our mind and into our body sensations can actually be really helpful and grounding and even illuminating when we ignore our feelings our body often starts shouting at us to get our attention so just listening to what our body is saying acknowledging the feelings and fears can be very clarifying and soothing,neutral

i would also like to point out that actually understanding machine learning well enough to tweak models effectively or read white papers on topics as was mentioned as a benefit being part of something will be extremely difficult to do without a fairly high level of knowledge in linear algebra and probability statistics in fact at my university in order to enrol in the first machine learning course you need to have taken 4 semesters of calculus with proofs as it highlights mathematical maturity one develops one or two courses in linear algebra and 2 courses in statistics that’s not to say it’s impossible to use ml without that of course it isn’t however it is difficult to engage academically with the material without sufficient math knowledge much more so than with required programming knowledge for ml so yes you will be “a part of something” in that as the field develops you might have fun new models to play around with but it’s a bit disingenuous to suggest people will be able to comprehend ml publications at a meaningful level or be generating their own custom models,neutral

at 818 does lossless support in airpods prob2 mean the iphone 14 etc will support any wireless lossless audio hardware such as the nuratrue pro that was recently funded in kickstarter i sure hope so because nura is offering dongles for those who want the best possible quality on hardware like iphones without support that capability would be a major draw for people who love hearing the best quality audio to upgrade their iphones btw i really don’t think airpods pro 2 will outdo the audio quality on the upcoming nuratrue nuraphone’s specs are insane i encourage people to go check them out and preorder to save money the kickstarter is over but i think they can still be preordered nura’s nuraphone their over ear and in ear model — yes you heard me right is still the best audio on the market 5 years after it’s release the nt pro is going to be the closest experience to that in an iem plus additional capabilities the nuraphone doesn’t have due to its now outdated hardware i use them daily it’s an amazing audio brand from australia great customer support too give them a try before you get ap pro 2 — nura let’s you try them and return if you don’t like them so there’s no risk you can also rent any nura product long term and trade up every two years apple doesn’t do any of that unfortunately,positive

my grandmother was a teenager living on a farm with her mother and father during these times in dongguan which has been the electronics manufacturer of the world for the past 10 years in the guangdong province her father died rather abruptly from inhaling toxic gases while clearing a crude drainage system on the farm and left my grandmother and her mother behind she says that before her farm was confiscated by the ccp her mother was actually compensated the equivalent of pennies on the dollar of what the farmland was worth but they really didnt have a choice in the matter there would always be distant relatives and strangers that would stay on their farm and freeload because they had nowhere else to go had no money and were starving my grandmothers mother was kind hearted and took in these less fortunate people as best as her means could provide at some point she housed and fed more than 1520 of them for many of them it was a sojourn whilst making their way down to hong kong which was free from the troubles of china at the time many had heard of the prosperity that the british colony had brought and wanted a piece of the pie some years later even my wifes father had swam across the seas to illegally enter hong kong when the government at the time announced they were issuing id cards for citizenship albeit his heart still belongs to china as the indoctrination that generation was subject to to them was really profound he would often complain to his children why do all of you not love china and they would retort if you love china so much what are you doing in hong kong to which he would become frustrated for having no good answer i asked my grandmother once do you think mao zedong is good and she enthusiastically answers without a second of hesitation yes yes hes wonderful and started blurting out the first few phrases of the chinese national anthem in song i guess its why that generation is called the lost generation,negative

data science is extremely saturated at entry level just ask anybody whos applied for a data science job in the last year moreover data analyst is being rebranded as data scientist because many businesses are realizing they never needed fancy deep learning or advanced statistical models to gain insight into their data but good ole basic analysis achieved the same end at a fraction of the cost if you actually want to work on ai projects these days and not just be a data analyst youll need a phd in computer science also despite having a higher barrier to entry the outlook for data science jobs is worse than that of software engineering because the demand is a lot less compared to software engineering as data science tools continue to be democratized and automated software engineers with basic stats skills will be favored for data roles due to their better coding skills as well as the fact that the job is just an analyst role so no longer requires advanced stats knowledge for the most part,neutral

something important to know for all who are interested in history andor support ukraine rus’ ought not to be confused with “russia” which derives its name from the rus’ but historically is a completely different state which almost all its existence was at war with the rus’ just like the holy roman empire was actually germany russia is actually muscovy despite their best attempts to convince everybody otherwise its name “russia received only in 1721 when peter i passed a decree to change tsardom of muscovy’s name into the “russian” empire “russia” originates from rosia name used by the greek orthodox clergy in regards to kyivan rus under the reign of cathrine ii muscovites where even punished for continuing to identify as muscovites and were forced to call themselves “russian” lands that “russia” claims were part of the original rus’ but actually werent are novgorod suzdal and ryazan since in historical texts of xixii centuries they are mentioned as separate entities from rus’ they can be considered parts of extended rus’ although their culture was distinct from main rus’ in 1493 moscow prince ivan iii appointed himself to be the great ruler of all rus’ no other kings acknowledged that from that point on muscovy started to make false claims on rus’ ownership “russia” is an offshoot of ukraine and not the other way round despite what soviet and “russian” historians have been trying to say for years kiev was a developed cultured capital when moscow was just another swamp village germany used to call itself the holy roman empire that didn’t mean they became the romans and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of italy and its history but yet that’s exactly what “russia” did in regards to rus’ukraine which is a horrible injustice,neutral

these next gen consoles shouldve shipped with more storage to begin with especially considering theyre backwards compatible with last gen but atleast xbox lets you connect more then 1 storage device if you dont mind moving games id suggest getting an ultra small flashdrive like the sandisk ultra fit you can easily fit 2 on the back usb ports on the xbox giving up to 1tb of more storage while still having room the expandable sdd too plus you can play the older xbox one games off the flashdrive sure you can do the same thing with a normal harddrive however using an ultra small flashdrive takes up no extra space meaning its easier to fit in an entertainment center plus it makes it easier if you move your console often,positive

some of my favorite voltaire quotes this man was a genius being a bird aint all about flying and shitting from high places it requires twenty years for a man to rise from the vegetable state in which he is within his mothers womb and from the pure animal state which is the lot of his early childhood to the state when the maturity of reason begins to appear it has required thirty centuries to learn a little about his structure it would need eternity to learn something about his soul it takes an instant to kill him of all religions the christian should of course inspire the most tolerance but until now christians have been the most intolerant of all men religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool uncertainty is an uncomfortable position but certainty is an absurd one if you have two religions in your land the two will cut each other’s throats but if you have thirty religions they will dwell in peace what can you say to a man who tells you he prefers obeying god rather than men and that as a result hes certain hell go to heaven if he cuts your throat behind every successful man stands a surprised motherinlaw it is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge animals have these advantages over man they never hear the clock strike they die without any idea of death they have no theologians to instruct them their last moments are not disturbed by unwelcome and unpleasant ceremonies their funerals cost them nothing and no one starts lawsuits over their wills the human brain is a complex organ with the wonderful power of enabling man to find reasons for continuing to believe whatever it is that he wants to believe our wretched species is so made that those who walk on the welltrodden path always throw stones at those who are showing a new road every man is a creature of the age in which he lives and few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the time despite the enormous quantity of books how few people read and if one reads profitably one would realize how much stupid stuff the vulgar herd is content to swallow every day i have wanted to kill myself a hundred times but somehow i am still in love with life this ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our more stupid melancholy propensities for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away to loathe one’s very being and yet to hold it fast to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities the more i read the more i acquire the more certain i am that i know nothing it is forbidden to kill therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets god is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh,neutral

just wanna real quick say that if you plan on being really good at building this is not the only tutorial you need not even remotely being an expert at building requires near perfect understanding of the basics ie what they are and how to execute them you need to understand most if not all of the simple concepts there are have a huge amount of tricks and ideas saved up for detailing and really anything for that matter often times even understand things like color theory there is way too much to becoming a good builder to fit into a single video especially an 8 minute one but as far as guidelines for people who just want a nice house this video is great pretty much everything is spot on and will make things look good almost every time you build it also if you want to get really into building i would recommend watching all of grians tutorials and once youve gotten to a decently advanced level watching tutorials from another far smaller youtuber who goes by horace minecraft he is an amazing content creator and is incredibly talented in his craft in my opinion even better than grian is though they do build in vastly different ways so there isnt much comparison that works there,neutral

here’s a story for you beginners i went into my first class of cse with no knowledge of coding i got a c in intro to java okay yeah i did bad but then i wanted to get better so i did some practice over the winter to improve my logic okay b in the next highest class the following semester software 1 then over the summer i was able to learn so many other languages swift python javascript i had all this growth in a little under a year all i’m saying is if you guys are worried about being a beginner who doesn’t know how to code and don’t think it will get easier trust me it gets easier do simple personal projects to help yourself get the flow of implementing your own logic in things like it else’s while for loops etc to help you gain a feel of how they work i would struggle on projects during the semester on how to make a blackjack game in java as a beginner this is a daunting task for me so over winter break i made projects such as modeling a car in java okay what functions does a car have accelerate decelerate break etc from then i could think of variables okay what could toggle a car being on or off oh a boolean oh maybe my car should run only when the gas level is greater than zero okay that’s loop there with gas level modeled as an int see things like this slowly helped my logic grow and now i can tackle any language or problem my class throws at me trust me i’m still a beginner as well but i ended up catching up to the kids around me when i was once behind and in times when you feel like giving up please don’t i urge you to stick through it because it does get easier,positive

you mentioned that bioinformatics is the field that uses computers to analyze genetic data when statistical methods arent enough but when statistical methods are enough that is a field called quantitative genetics and using it we can often tell whether a trait is genetic without having to know which specific genes are involved it can also help give candidates for molecular genetic study to find the genes relating to those traits,neutral
very entertaining one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected i remember my wife was given a free ticket to a diamondbacks game which went zerozero so she finally left and when she came home she said i got bored with the game the diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left winning the game i teased her endlessly after that suggesting she should not attend more dbacks games and they went on to win the world series that year my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the yankees and luis gonzalez base hit that won the game i met joe montana and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl and i saw the ending in french in montreal in 90 during my flight from sfo to toronto and the connecting flight to montreal our air canada pilot gave us updates on a onesided blowout i also will never forget the stanfordcal game in 82 and the play when cal beat stanford and the band became part of the game some still argue over two of the lateral passes but the win for cal was as it was and i still say that is among the craziest moments in sports history my own crazy moment was when i was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team even though i was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team the school we played had no players above the sixth grade so i agreed we won the game though i had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game adrenalin had me psyched and our qb said i threw perfect spirals i would intimidate the bigger players since they feared id plow under them and stop them from getting to the qb and they never did he was not sacked our team went on to win the norcal championship undefeated in our twelve team league my brother playing as wide receiver though i no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders i never went on to play in high school feeling i was too small to be as good as i was in my grammar school game where i also played on the defense and i stuck to distance cycling and golf both of which i enjoyed and also had many crazy moments and i was decent at the 440 as it was then now the 400 meters even in my early 60s now and despite a leg i broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago i still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing on my channel here cactus521 i even have a video of me jumping off the vegas stratosphere tower when i was 52 though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered i felt peace and not fear on the way down choosing that vs skydiving as my free fall bucket list item since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane ,positive

 these are some most important and precious advices every one should read  1 take risks in your life if you win you can lead if you lose you can guide 2 people are not what they say but what they do so judge them not from their words but from their actions 3 when someone hurts you dont feel bad because its a law of nature that the tree that bears the sweetest fruits gets maximum number of stones 4 take whatever you can from your life because when life starts taking from you it takes even your last breath 5 in this world people will always throw stones on the path of your success it depends on what you make from them a wall or a bridge 6 challenges make life interesting overcoming them make life meaningful 7 there is no joy in victory without running the risk of defeat 8 a path without obstacles leads nowhere 9 past is a nice place to visit but certainly not a good place to stay 10 you cant have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time 11 if what you did yesterday still looks big to you then you havent done much today 12 if you dont build your dreams someone else will hire you to build theirs 13 if you dont climb the mountain you cant view the plain 14 dont leave it idle use your brain 15 you are not paid for having brain you are only rewarded for using it intelligently 16 it is not what you dont have that limits you it is what you have but dont know how to use 17 what you fail to learn might teach you a lesson 18 the difference between a corrupt person and an honest person is the corrupt person has a price while the honest person has a value 19 if you succeed in cheating someone dont think that the person is a fool realize that the person trusted you much more than you deserved i 20 honesty is an expensive gift dont expect it from cheap people i hope you have learnt something you can recieve more from my this channel,positive
